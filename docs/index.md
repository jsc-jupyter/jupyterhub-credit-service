# JupyterHub Credit Service

The **JupyterHub Credit Service** is a python package that can be installed as an extension to JupyterHub. It introduces a lightweight, flexible system to limit **resource consumption** on a **per-user** and/or **per-project** model.

It enables administrators to control how long users can use computational environments, and how shared project resources are allocated â€” all without complex accounting or billing systems.

## Overview

In vanilla JupyterHub deployments administrators can limit the amount of servers a user can spawn with `c.JupyterHub.named_server_limit_per_user`. This does not take into account what `user_options` a user has chosen.  
The **JupyterHub Credit Service** offers a detailed **per-user** configuration, depending on the chosen **Spawner configurations**, with a **credit-based quota system**:

- Each **user** has a personal maximum amount of credits.
- Each **user** gains new credits every `n` seconds.  
- Each **server** consumes credits over time based on its configuration.  
- **Projects** can share credits among their members to support community based access restrictions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install jupyterhub-credit-service
```

## Usage

Example `jupyterhub_config.py` configuration:  
```jupyterhub_config.py
import jupyterhub_credit_service

# Configure Authenticator
from oauthenticator.generic import GenericOAuthenticator 
# Use any Authenticator you usually use together with the CreditsAuthenticator
class MixinAuthenticator(GenericOAuthenticator, jupyterhub_credit_service.CreditsAuthenticator):
    pass

c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = MixinAuthenticator

# Different users may get different amount of credits
def user_cap(username, user_groups=[], is_admin=False):
    if username.endswith("mycompany.org"):
        return 1000
    elif username.endswith("googlemail.com") or username.endswith("gmail.com"):
        return 30
    return 100

c.MixinAuthenticator.credits_user_cap = user_cap  # may be a callable or integer
c.MixinAuthenticator.credits_user_grant_value = 5 # may be a callable or integer
c.MixinAuthenticator.credits_user_grant_interval = 600 # Gain 5 credits every 10 minutes, may be a callable or integer

c.MixinAuthenticator.userinfo_url = ... # your normal configuration


# Configure Spawner
import kubespawner
# You can reuse the "KubeSpawner" name so you don't have to change your other configs
class KubeSpawner(kubespawner.KubeSpawner, jupyterhub_credit_service.CreditsSpawner):
    pass

def get_billing_value(spawner):
    # Costs gpus*10 credits + 5 credits, per billing_interval
    billing_value = 5
    if "gpus" in spawner.user_options.keys():
        billing_value += spawner.user_options["gpus"] * 10
    return billing_value

c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = KubeSpawner
c.KubeSpawner.billing_value = get_billing_value # may be a callable or integer
c.KubeSpawner.billing_interval = 600 # Pay credits depending on gpus usage every 10 minutes, may be a callable or integer
```
